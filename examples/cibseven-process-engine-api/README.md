# CIB seven Bike-Leasing Blueprint

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

A solution template to fork for automating a business process on [CIB seven](https://cibseven.org)
(the community fork of Camunda 7): one complete, production-shaped BPMN service on an **embedded
engine** with Spring Boot. It talks to the engine through the
[**process-engine-api**](https://github.com/bpm-crafters) (bpm-crafters) instead of the plain CIB seven
APIs, while Cockpit/Tasklist and `/engine-rest` remain available. It is still a work in progress.

## Pick your stack

| | [`kotlin-gradle/`](kotlin-gradle/README.md) | [`java-maven/`](java-maven/README.md) |
|---|---|---|
| **Stack** | Kotlin 2.4 · Gradle | Java 21 · Maven |
| **Choose it when** | you are free to choose — **our recommendation for a modern stack** | Java + Maven is your team's or company's standard, or you are in a training |

Both run the same process behind the same REST contract — [turn the repo into a single-stack starter](docs/starter.md) with one command.

## The process

![The bike-leasing process](docs/assets/bike-leasing.png)

**MiraVelo** is a fictional bike brand that sells on a leasing model. The service takes a leasing
application from the first request to an active lease and deliberately covers the BPMN elements you
meet in real processes: a message start event, service tasks as process-engine-api workers and a DMN
business-rule task, an embedded sub-process with an event-based gateway and a non-interrupting
reminder timer, a parallel fork/join, a user task with a Camunda Form (completable in the Tasklist or
via REST), compensation / SAGA handlers guarded by error and escalation boundary events, a call
activity, a withdrawal message event sub-process and a terminate end event.

## Quick start

Requires JDK 21 and Docker (or Podman).

```bash
docker compose -f stack/docker-compose.yml up -d   # Postgres on :5432
# variant:kotlin-gradle
cd kotlin-gradle && ./gradlew :service:app:bootRun   # service + embedded engine on :8080
# /variant:kotlin-gradle
# variant:java-maven
cd java-maven && ./mvnw -pl service/app -am spring-boot:run   # service + embedded engine on :8080
# /variant:java-maven
```
